# An Online Payment Service

This project is about the design and implementation of a web-based, multi-user payment service using the Django framework. The system is a much-simplified version of PayPal. Through a  web interface, users should be able to send money to other registered users (e.g., using their registered email address as their unique identifier), request money from other registered users and manage their own account (e.g., look at their recent transactions). Super-users (i.e., admins) should be able to access all user accounts and transactions. 

#### To run, install django and run the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
